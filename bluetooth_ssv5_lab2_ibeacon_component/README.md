# Adding an iBeacon Component to SoC_Empty #

## Summary ##

This project illustrates how to add an iBeacon component to the base SoC_Empty Bluetooth project found in the Simplicity Studio v5 tools.  The example is one of four solutions to lab exercises included in a training using the Simplicity Studio v5 project flow and highlights the use of the Universal Configurator (UC) to add components to projects.  The step by step instructions for the labs and other background information can be found using the Silicon Labs [lab manual](docs.silabs.com).

Lab manual contents:

- Lab 1:  Getting Started with SoC_Empty
- **Lab 2:  Turn SoC_Empty into an iBeacon using Universal Configurator**
- Lab 3:  Enhancing an Application Using Custom Services and Components
- Lab 4:  A Deeper Dive into Components and Using Them with the Bluetooth Stack

What you will learn in lab 2:

- Add new components to a project
- Component dependencies
- Viewing autogenerated files
- Build and download an application to a target
- Introduced EFR Connect mobile app

## Setup ##

1. Please see the lab manual for step by step instructions on how to create the example from scratch starting with the SoC_Empty project.  
1. To skip having to run through the lab manual and use the provided source file, create SoC_Empty project and replace the default **_app.c_** file with the one in the src directory incuded with this project.
1. To use the exported .sls project file, import the included .sls file to Studio then build and flash the project to the SLTB010A STK.
   1. In Simplicity Studio select "**File->Import**" and navigate to the directory with the _.sls_ project file.
