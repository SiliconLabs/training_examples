This folder contains source code used in the Dev Lab: Adafruit 13x9 RGB LED Matrix training video.

The folders are arranged as follows:

* `Common` contains code used in both the Bluetooth and Matter over Thread examples
* `Bluetooth` contains the final application code for the Bluetooth example
* `Matter` contains the final application code for the Matter over Thread example

## About

**Description:**

This Dev Lab integrates Adafruit's 13x9 RGB LED Matrix into Bluetooth and Matter over Thread wireless applications.

You will learn:

* How to add a driver for the LED matrix into existing applications
* How to draw icons on the LED matrix
* How to control the LED matrix when lighting commands are received in a Bluetooth and Matter over Thread application
* How to enable development Matter over Thread devices in Google Home's ecosystem
