## About

A video for this Dev Lab is available on [YouTube](https://get.silabs.com/gh963yt).

This project-based Dev Lab walks through the creation of a Wi-Fi HTTP Server using the Silicon Labs energy-efficient SiWG917 Wi-Fi 6 SoC. In the video you will how to:

* Connect and setup SiWG917 boards in the Simplicity Studio v5 IDE
* Create, build and run the Wi-Fi HTTP Server example application
* Adapt the application to serve an auto-refreshing HTML page which includes the board button states
* Make the joining and rejoining process robust
* How to use software APIs to construct Wi-Fi applications for the SiWG917
