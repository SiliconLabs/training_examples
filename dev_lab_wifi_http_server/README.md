This project-based Dev Lab walks through the creation of a Wi-Fi HTTP Server using the Silicon Labs energy-efficient SiWG917 Wi-Fi 6 SoC. In the video you will how to:

* Connect and setup SiWG917 boards in the Simplicity Studio v5 IDE
* Create, build and run the Wi-Fi HTTP Server example application
* Adapt the application to serve an auto-refreshing HTML page which includes the board button states
* Make the joining and rejoining process robust
* How to use software APIs to construct Wi-Fi applications for the SiWG917

### SiWG917 Sleeping Wi-Fi HTTP Server

This video is coming soon and provides step-by-step instructions for adding sleep modes to the HTTP Server in order to save power. It covers:

* How to measure power using Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler
* How to enable the Network Wireless Processor (NWP) sleep modes using code
* How to enable the Application Processor (M4) sleep modes using code and Software Components
