This two-part project-based Dev Lab walks through the creation of a Wi-Fi HTTP Server using the Silicon Labs energy-efficient SiWG917 Wi-Fi 6 SoC. 

The first part starts with the basic HTTP Server example which is included in the Simplicity Studio v5 IDE. The application is then enhanced to serve an auto-refreshing HTML page that includes a timer value and button states. The joining and rejoining process is also improved to make it more robust. The APIs used to create the application are covered along the way.

The second part shows how to apply sleep modes using code and Software Components  to the application to save power, including the use of Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler to measure the current of the application.

### [Dev Lab - Arduino Matter over Thread Occupancy Sensor](dev_lab_arduino_matter_occupancy_sensor/README.md)

![Dev Lab - Arduino Matter over Thread Occupancy Sensor](images/Arduino-Matter-Occupancy-Sensor-200p.png)

This project-based Dev Lab steps through the creation of a Matter over Thread Occupancy Sensor in the Arduino IDE using the Arduino Nano Matter board and an optional SR602 PIR sensor that can be connected on a breadboard. The final device reports its occupancy state to a Matter hub which can be configured to perform actions when the occupancy state changes.

### [Dev Lab - Arduino Matter over Thread Mood Light](dev_lab_arduino_matter_mood_light/README.md)

![Dev Lab - Arduino Matter over Thread Mood Light](images/Arduino-Matter-Mood-Light-200p.png)

This Dev Lab walks through the creation of a Matter over Thread Mood Light using the Arduino IDE. The Dev Lab uses the Arduino Nano Matter board and is compatible with other EFR32MG24 boards featuring Silicon Labs EFRMG24 multi-protocol wireless microcontroller. The completed device includes two color bulb endpoints, modes are available to display solid colors, animated gradients between the two colors and a variety of plasma-like animations. The device can be commissioned into Matter ecosystems from Amazon, Google and Apple.

### [Quick Start - Arduino Nano Matter](quick_start_arduino_nano_matter/README.md)

![Quick Start - Arduino Nano Matter](images/Arduino-Nano-Matter-200p.png)

This quick start video introduces the Arduino Nano Matter board and shows how to get started developing Matter over Thread applications. In the video the Matter Dimmable Lightbulb example is adapted to drive and animate a WS2812 RGB LED strip to display the brightness of the light. This example makes the final source code available for download and use.

### [Dev Lab - CircuitPython Bluetooth Find Me](dev_lab_circuitpython_bluetooth_find_me/README.md)

![Dev Lab - CircuitPython Bluetooth Find Me](images/Find-Me-200p.png)

This project-based Dev Lab steps through the creation of a Bluetooth Find Me device using CircuitPython. The device operates as a key finder, playing alert tunes using a passive piezo buzzer when activated. Activation can be triggered from a mobile phone using the EFR Connect application or by pressing a button on another Find Me device.
