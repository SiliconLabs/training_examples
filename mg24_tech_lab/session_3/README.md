## AI/ML Partner Tool ##
This workshop will allow you to evaluate a Third Party Partner Tool for topics 3 of the series. For an ML Explorer, this tool covers the end-to-end workflow for creating a machine learning neural network model and accompanying embedded software to include in your application. To use the tool, you will need to create an account on Edge Impulse’s website and intall their CLI tool prior to working through topic 3.

**Topic 3:  Accelerate AI/ML at the Edge with xG24 and Edge Impulse**

Edge Impulse is a development platform that can be used to create intelligent device solutions with machine learning on embedded devices. This section will go over getting set up with Edge Impulse.

1. Create an account on Edge Impulse’s website [HERE](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/signup?next=%2Fstudio%2Fselect-project%3Fautoredirect%3D1).
