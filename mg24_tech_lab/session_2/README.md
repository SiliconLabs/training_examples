## Summary ##
  - SensiML’ s Analytic Toolkit for developing inference models
  - Demonstrating acoustic event recognition for smart home and predictive maintenance applications
  - Hands-On: Deploying inference model to xG24 to recognize acoustic events

## [Lab Procedure: Guitar Note Audio Recognition](https://sensiml.com/documentation/application-tutorials/guitar-tuning-notes-audio-recognition.html#what-you-need-to-get-started) ##
In this tutorial, we are going to build a model to classify guitar tuning notes that can run entirely on a microcontroller using the SensiML Analytics Toolkit. This tutorial will provide you with the knowledge to build an audio recognition model. You will learn how to:

- Collect and annotate audio data

- Applying signal preprocessing

- Train a classification algorithm

- Create firmware optimized for the resource budget of an edge device

## Hardware Requirements ##

- [One EFR32xG24 Dev Kit](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg24-dev-kit)
- Micro-USB to USB Type-A Cable
- Mobile Phone
## Software Requirements ##

- [Simplicity Studio v5](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio/simplicity-studio-5)
  - GSDK v4.0.2
  - Bluetooth SDK 3.3.2
- [EFR Connect Mobile App](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/bluetooth-low-energy/mobile-apps/efr-connect)
- [Data Capture Lab Project File](lab_files/Guitar%20Note%20Recognition.zip)

## AI/ML Partner Tool ##
This workshop will allow you to evaluate a Third Party Partner Tools for topics 2 of the series. For an ML Explorer, these tools cover the end-to-end workflow for creating a machine learning neural network model and accompanying embedded software to include in your application. To use the tool, you will need to create an account on SensiML’s website and intall their tools prior to working through topic 2.
